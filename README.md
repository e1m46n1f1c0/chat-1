# Bizchat
A PHP and MySQL based online chat. Includes simplistic private chat modules, commands, and administrative abilities.

#TO DO:
* Add better configuration for user-only notifcations
* Clean the sh*t out of the post.php file
* Switch if-then style formatting into functions and maybe a class
* Fix image sharing, XSS vulnerable as of now by abusing ?x=.jpg. Either removing entirely or updating.
* Fix constant chat updates. Look into AJAX updating via comparison.
* Make all log files only readable by system

#License (someone told me to do this):
* Anyone who uses some or all of this framework is not allowed to claim ownership of it, that is all.
* You are freely able to manipulate or implement your own changes to the project.
* If you attempt to monetize this project you must clearly give credit to the author
* (This is my first time writing one of these, it's pretty bad, I know)

# Version 1.0
* Very personalized, version 1.1 will be more based around the user with setup files.
* Commmand based, standard users have access to "/color" and "/dice"

# Version 1.1
* Added configuration file, "settings.php"
* Updated post.php commands, added "/changepassword"
* Edited Style for personalized titles
